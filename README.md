# Global-Conflict-Mapping-UN-Involvement-Data-Science-Exploration-with-3D-Geopolitical-Visualization

Project Title: Global Conflict Mapping and United Nations Involvement â€“ A Comprehensive Data Science Exploration using 3D Geographical and Geopolitical Visualization

This data science project was developed over a span of 15 days, with the primary objective of visualizing and analyzing global conflict zones and examining the United Nations' role in these regions. By utilizing a range of data science techniques, tools, and libraries, the project effectively maps the geographical and geopolitical aspects of conflicts, using both historical and real-time data to gain insights into international crises.

Key Technologies, Tools, and Libraries Used:

Data Visualization: Plotly and Matplotlib were used to create highly interactive 2D and 3D visualizations, including geographical maps, which depict conflict zones and UN involvement across the globe.

Geospatial Analysis: Tools such as GeoPandas, Folium, and Shapely were employed to manage and visualize geospatial data. GeoPandas allowed efficient handling of geographical data, while Folium helped create interactive 2D maps and Shapely was used for geometrical operations on coordinates.

3D Visualization: Using Plotly, the project integrates 3D geographical visualizations for enhanced understanding. The 3D maps provide a comprehensive perspective on the conflicts, enabling users to view the global situation from multiple angles.

Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy were critical for data wrangling, allowing for efficient data manipulation and analysis. This ensured smooth handling of the large datasets used in the project.

Big Data Processing: Apache Spark was leveraged for processing and analyzing large-scale data related to conflicts. Spark enabled scalable data processing, ensuring efficient handling of extensive datasets sourced from the UN and other global organizations.

Machine Learning Models: Scikit-learn was used to apply machine learning models for classifying and predicting conflict escalation and potential UN intervention outcomes. These models added predictive capabilities to the project, providing insights into possible future scenarios.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): SpaCy and NLTK were used for processing and analyzing textual data from UN reports and global news articles. NLP was essential in extracting insights from the textual content, enriching the data used for visualizations.

Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup and Scrapy were used to gather data from external sources, including UN databases, governmental reports, and global conflict datasets.

Data Sources: The project utilized multiple datasets, including official United Nations data, governmental conflict databases, and publicly available data from other reliable sources.

Visualization Tools and Techniques:

2D Maps: Folium was used to create interactive 2D maps to visualize conflict zones and UN interventions. These maps provide users with detailed, zoomable views of specific conflict regions.

3D Maps: Plotly's 3D visualization capabilities were used to create globe-like representations of conflict regions. These 3D maps offer a comprehensive view of geopolitical interactions and allow users to visualize data in an engaging manner.

Globe Visualization: The project includes an interactive globe visualization that allows users to rotate and explore conflict zones and UN actions globally.

This project merges data science, geospatial analysis, and machine learning to create a powerful tool for understanding global conflicts. By integrating real-time data and presenting it through interactive 3D visualizations, it provides invaluable insights for policymakers, researchers, and global organizations.
